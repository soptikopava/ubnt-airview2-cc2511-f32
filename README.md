# ubnt-airview2-cc2511-f32
 Hi,
 
 I have a USB dongle AirView2 in my drawer. I would like to find a new use for it. Maybe a sniffing device.
 AirView2 is a special Spectrum analyzer for the 2.4 GHz band.

AirView2 has:
- USB Type A
- MMCX for external antenna
- CC2511-F32 CPU
- green LED
- pin on PCB for Button
- pin PWR (power)
- RESET_N pin
- pin CLK
- pin DATA
- GND pin

Do you have any idea?
